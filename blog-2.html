            <p class="lead">It's been a year staying at SF. 
              I feel that nothing has changed compared to yesterday but when I look back to last year, 
              I realize a lot of things have changed for me. 
              There are some obvious external changes and some changes within me that you won't notice until you spend some time with me. </p>

            <p>Weather
                They said go to California, weather is great in California they said.
                
                I have stayed in hot weather of Mumbai for most of my life. 
                Spent couple years in hot weather of Arizona. 
                In all, I am naturally adaptive of hot weather but have no experience in taking cold. 
                After moving to San Francisco, I added lot of different types of jackets to my wardrobe. 
                I have legit separate wardrobe for winter now. I stay few blocks from ocean. 
                Early mornings and evenings are foggy for me most of the times. 
                In general, SF is popular as a fog city. 
                There are days that I can count with my fingers when I can leave home without carrying a jacket through out a year. 
                But like most techies in bay area, I learnt to wear a hoodie on daily basis. 
                Sometimes layering up with a winter jacket on top of hoodie is now part of my life.</p>

            <p>Home
                I have always been a beach person. I spent quite some time to find out a house near beach. 
                In one year I stayed at 2 different places, both near ocean. I love the place where I stay right now. 
                It's a block from golden gate park, and my roommates are super nice and fun. 
                If you have ever stayed in SF, you will know how big of a deal it is to find a place that is affordable + good (in x different dimensions). 
                I have been lucky! I am moving again as my fiance comes to stay with me for good. 
                Enjoying current place right now before we start with house hunting process again! </p>

            <p>People
                In one year staying in SF, I have stayed with roommates from different countries, 
                different genders working in crazy different areas. 
                One of my roommates was a cop and she worked at Alcatraz. 
                Other roommate was self learnt surfer, wrapper, guitar player with a day job in solar industry. 
                I have learnt a lot from all of them. We have had polish parties happening at home, 
                Spanish barbeque in the backyard and my sister threw Pani puri(Indian snack) party for my friends when she visited me. 
                I have learnt a lot about different cultures from just staying with people. 
                Similarly my work place is very diverse too. 
                People with whom I hang out are from all different parts of world. 
                Besides, I used Shapr, LinkedIn apps to have coffee with seniors in my field working in companies like Airbnb, Intuit, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Facebook. 
                It was very humbling experience when CTO of E&Y came down to Yelp to have coffee with me( Thanks Ken, your few minutes did wonders to me). 
                I have memories of meeting with so many more folks that changed tiny bit if me just by being who they are. 
                May be I will write a new blog to cover that.</p>

            <p>Culture 
                I have always been a person who is open to learn. 
                After being friends with wonderful people from different places, I believe more in humanity than in any particular culture, 
                including my own culture. I believe that people are free to chose thier religion, sex or gender. 
                I am close to folks who society identifes as gay/ lesbian/ transgender. 
                As I dig deeper and spend more time with them, it becomes clearer that we are all humans who function differently. 
                And everyone is trying to be happy in thier own ways. Period.</p>

            <p> Work
                I am not saying that every company in SF has culture that makes you feel excited to go to work. 
                But mine does! I make my own decisions, chose my own projects, consider the company as mine and work for hours that 
                leave me with great work-life balance. If you ask engineers at Yelp about what they like about working here, 
                mostly the answer will be either culture or people. 
                I am part of Awesome Women in Engineering at Yelp, that gives me opportunity to continue working in one of the many causes I believe in, 
                women empowerment and career development. I have had worse of managers in my career, 
                I have worked for 6 days a week from 9am to 9pm and I could say that I really appreciate the job I currently have. (Yelp++)</p>

            <p>Conclusion
                In all, I love the city and I love how diverse and accepting people in this city are. 
                This is helping me grow in various aspects. 
                I don't realize how things have changed within me d until I sit back and reflect on where 
                I have come in a year's time. Very grateful for everything this city gave me, and I am excited for the future. 
                I will end this with a line that I read somewhere, "Change is constant but growth is optional".</p>


              <p>PS: If you feel that I am lucky to be living this kind of life, just a note that all of this was super intentional and not based on just luck. 
                I interviewed for 7 months before getting job at Yelp. 
                I didn't have money to come to the US to study in grad school at first place, my uncles helped me. 
                My faince (then boyfriend) broke up with me thrice before he got me a ring. 
                I chose what I wanted out of a situation to continue growing. 
                A friend of mine said, Tanvi, you have changed, I like the old you more. Well, I don't judge them, 
                it just gives me a reality check on how much I grew.</p>
